            1D projections of topics obtained from topic modeling are shown for topic numbers ranging from 10 to 28. Each row represents the projection for a specific topic number. The dimensionality reduction techniques applied in these projections are: (a) t-SNE, (b) UMAP, and (c) MDS. Each topic is connected to its most similar topics in the projections above and below. The projection technique with fewer crossing links (t-SNE in our case with 7 crossings) is the best option for further analysis.

                <strong>Figure 2a:</strong> A comprehensive visualization of topic signatures (spatial heatmaps), derived from topic modeling across a range of topic numbers (10 to 28, as labeled at each line). Each heatmap represents a football pitch, with the darkness of its grid cells proportional to the respective weights in the topic-term matrix. The attacking direction is from bottom to top. The final selected topic number is 16 (indicated by an arrow). The group in the pink rectangle illustrates spatial consistency, while the group in the brown rectangle demonstrates redundancy.

                <strong>Figure 2b:</strong> A detailed view of the topics selected within the brown rectangle. The interactive tool highlights topics with cells colored red/blue when higher/lower than the average of the selection. The presence of red cells in the first three rows and a mix of red and blue cells in the last three rows suggests that the cell values have been distributed between two similar topics in the branches.

Left side: segmented bar charts on a timeline depict active topics (IDs 0--15), with Barcelona (above the dashed line, green) and Real Madrid (below, red). Each bar is labeled at the top with its dominant topic ID, along with markers for key match events and successful episodes. Right side: Summary columns compare aggregated topic weights (All, Successful, Unsuccessful) and include a difference plot to highlight contrasts between the two teams.
